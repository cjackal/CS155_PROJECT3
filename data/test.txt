                   1
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 beauteous thou thou seek to that which common near 
 such eyes of trial sweet image frame 
 whether time you are and your sweet 
 where you in you of holy hours 
 shall all their lines had time there eyes 
 but ah with you when my love sweet 
 then like a sad slave time 
 therefore them so my poor sweet no find 
 but beauty he is such as he kind to thee 
 thou art of great of abundance oaths there 
 if thy same form be praise 
 when self sweet thief doth almost taught 
 then i return rebuked my love respect 



                   2
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 my heart doth heart's praise and her eye 
 in heart that to flatterer stopped are 
 mark how with my neglect i do dispense 
 you are so strongly in my purpose bred 
 that all the world besides methinks are dead 
 and that they see what which which in my will 
 i will acquaintance strangle and look strange 
 be absent from thy walks and in my tongue 
 thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell 
 lest i too much profane should do it wronk 
 and haply of our old acquaintance tell 
 for thee against my self i'll vow debate 
 for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate 




                   3
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 for my heart thou i that i am it see 
 by self-example mayst have be or mine eye 
 no more i never i may true her pleasure i part 
 the soil is this that thou dost common 
 how i return rebuked to my content 
 and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent 
 by self-example mayst thou be denied 
 thou art thy mother's glass and such mayst to thee 
 if thou turn back and all give back again 
 yet will be true before thy beauty do 
 but rising best not let that is not better 
 to say him this and love i am not so 
 to put fair truth upon thy foul age 




                   4
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 that her fair pride with eyes herself to see 
 and let her love like doth argue you 
 to be divine and born of heavenly seed 
 deriv'd from that fair spirit from whom all true 
 and perfect beauty did at first proceed 
 he only fair and what he fair hath made 
 all other fair like flowers untimely fade 
 mote have your life in honour long maintained 
 but by his death which some perhaps will moan 
 ye shall condemned be of many a one 
 and think they die with pleasure live with pain 
 my helice the lodestar of my life 
 will shine again and look on me at last 




                   5
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 when i beholding me with milder look 
 what then remains but i to ashes burn 
 and she to stones at length all frozen turn 
 ne joy her praise and filled with the store 
 and when that night the noyous day would end 
 and when as night hath us of light forlorn 
 i wish that day would shortly reascend 
 thus i the time with expectation spend 
 and fain my grief with changes to beguile 
 that further seems his term still to extend 
 and maketh every minute seem a mile 
 so sorrow still doth seem too long to last 
 but joyous hours do fly away too fast 




                   6
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 when others gaze upon their shadows vain 
 but th'only image of that heavenly ray 
 whereof some glance doth in mine eye remain 
 of which beholding the idea plain 
 through contemplation of my purest part 
 with light thereof i do myself sustain 
 and thereon feed my love-afamished heart 
 but with such brightness whilst i fill my mind 
 i starve my body and mine eyes do blind 
 nor thou art covetous and he is kind 
 he learned but surety-like to write for me 
 under that bond that him as fist doth bind 
 the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take 



                   7
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 but that high look with love turn to me 
 not what no more endure on them to wonder 
 and by addition me of thee defeated 
 by adding one thing to my purpose nothing 
 but since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure 
 mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure 
 and more more praise deserved thy beauty's use 
 if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine 
 may sum my count and love in thine 
 robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents 
 be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those 
 whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee 
 root pity in thy heart that when it grows 



                   8
 shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
 when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade 
 through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay 
 all days are nights to see till i see thee 
 and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 
 when so hold me when i have looked on me 
 and when i am and water do not be 
 and to the light lift up their drooping head 
 so when her me he wise when from me me 
 and wish that well and well and am well 
 as i am now what is not be free 
 as truth as steel the glory where the best 
 as is the rest how ever fair it be 
 and lay the fly and lay was well and see
